 * 1. CSS Styling:
 *    - ✅ Red warning-colored delete buttons (.delete-game-btn, .delete-btn)
 *    - ✅ Hover effects for better user interaction
 *    - ✅ Disabled state styling for loading states
 *    - ✅ Consistent styling across Game.css and StorageSystem.css
 * 
 * 2. User Experience:
 *    - ✅ Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions
 *    - ✅ Clear warning messages about cascading deletions
 *    - ✅ Loading states during deletion operations
 *    - ✅ Proper error messages if deletion fails
 *    - ✅ Automatic UI updates after successful deletion
 * 
 * 
 * 🧪 TESTING RESULTS
 * ==================
 * 
 * Backend API Tests:
 * - ✅ Created test game: "Test Game for Deletion" (ID: 684495893aff0744c5695a4d)
 * - ✅ Successfully deleted test game via API
 * - ✅ Created test storage: "Test Storage for Deletion" (ID: 684495973aff0744c5695a51)
 * - ✅ Successfully deleted test storage via API
 * - ✅ All endpoints return proper success messages
 * 
 * Frontend Tests:
 * - ✅ Application running at http://localhost:3001
 * - ✅ Delete buttons visible when items are selected
 * - ✅ CSS styling applied correctly (red warning buttons)
 * - ✅ Components recompiled successfully with new functionality
 * 
 * 
 * 🔄 CASCADE DELETION BEHAVIOR
 * ============================
 * 
 * Current Implementation:
 * - Deleting a Game: Only deletes the game record
 * - Deleting a Storage System: Only deletes the storage system record
 * - Deleting an Item: Only deletes the item record
 * 
 * Note: Database relationships are maintained via MongoDB ObjectId references.
 * If true cascading deletion is needed (automatically delete child records),
 * this would require additional backend logic using MongoDB middleware or
 * manual cleanup queries.
 * 
 * 
 * 🌐 FRONTEND URLS FOR TESTING
 * ============================
 * 
 * Main Application: http://localhost:3001
 * 
 * Test Scenarios:
 * 1. Go to main page, select a game, see delete button
 * 2. Click delete, see confirmation dialog
 * 3. Confirm deletion, see game removed from list
 * 4. Navigate to storage systems, select one, see delete button
 * 5. Test storage system deletion with confirmation
 * 6. Navigate to items page, test existing item deletion
 * 
 * 
 * 📋 USER INSTRUCTIONS
 * ====================
 * 
 * To test delete functionality:
 * 
 * 1. Games:
 *    - Go to http://localhost:3001
 *    - Select any game from dropdown
 *    - Click red "Delete Game" button
 *    - Confirm in the dialog popup
 *    - Game will be removed from the list
 * 
 * 2. Storage Systems:
 *    - Navigate to any game's storage systems
 *    - Select a storage system from dropdown
 *    - Click red "Delete Storage System" button
 *    - Confirm in the dialog popup
 *    - Storage system will be removed from the list
 * 
 * 3. Items:
 *    - Navigate to any storage system's items
 *    - Select an item from dropdown
 *    - Click red "Delete Item" button
 *    - Item will be removed from the list
 * 
 * 
 * ⚠️ SAFETY FEATURES
 * ==================
 * 
 * - Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions
 * - Warning messages explain what will happen
 * - Delete buttons are clearly styled in warning red
 * - Loading states prevent multiple deletion attempts
 * - Error handling shows user-friendly messages
 * - UI automatically updates to reflect changes
